I made this to create an open project that anyone can use, contribute, and learn for.

## Important Note:
If you want to open this, make sure to enable blender import and also set the blender executable path in Godot

## Software Used:
* Game Engine: [Godot Engine 4](https://godotengine.org/)
* Character Creation: [VRoid Studio](https://vroid.com/en/studio)
* Motion Data: [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/)
* 3D Editor: [Blender 3D](https://www.blender.org/)
* VFX: [Effekseer](https://effekseer.github.io/en/index.html)

Some of the software that I use here are free and open source like blender and effekseer, and they are really capable of doing some impressive works.
Also VRoid, is not an open source project, but it is a very powerful tool to create anime style character.
